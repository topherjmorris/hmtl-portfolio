<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello world, it's nice to have you stop by! While you are here, be sure to take a look at my projects. I have been building websites and applications for a few years and would love to hear about your upcoming project. I currently reside in Austin, TX with my wife and our 2 dogs. I'm a singer/songwriter as well as an avid gamer of 2 games. Diablo 4 & Baldur's Gate 3. I'm always looking for the next big tech thing and love reading about digital marketing trends.</p>
